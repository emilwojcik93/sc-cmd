## Introduction
I was looking for description of parameters for latest LIVE version of Star Citizen but I donâ€™t find any, so in this repo I would like to collect all available (working) parameters for this game. All informations will be placed in wiki of this repo.
Those parameters and their descriptions was capture through game console "~" and "Game.log" file which is located %ROOT% dir. Parameters can be modified through USER.cfg file that's should be located in %USER% dir.
