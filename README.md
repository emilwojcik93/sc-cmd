## Introduction
I was looking for description of parameters for latest LIVE version of Star Citizen but I donâ€™t find any, so in this repo I would like to collect all available (working) parameters for this game. All informations will be placed in wiki of this repo. Those parameters and their descriptions was capture through %CONSOLE% and %LOG% file.

## Usage
%CONSOLE% support Copy [CTRL+C] and Paste [CRTL+V] keyboard shortcut also like it's mention in Introduction all logs are stored in %LOG% file. Parameters can be modified through USER.cfg file that's have to be created in %USER% dir.
