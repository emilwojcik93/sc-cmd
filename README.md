## Introduction
I was looking for description of parameters for latest LIVE version of Star Citizen but I donâ€™t find any, so in this repo I would like to collect all available (working) parameters for this game. All informations will be placed in wiki of this repo. Those parameters and their descriptions was capture through %CONSOLE% and %LOG% file.

## Usage
%CONSOLE% support Copy [CTRL+C] and Paste [CRTL+V] keyboard shortcut also like it's mention in Introduction all logs are stored in %LOG% file. Parameters can be modified through USER.cfg file that's have to be created in %USER% dir.

   - to list all allowed parameters just type in %CONSOLE% `/` and press `TAB` button. 
   - to get description of parameter in %CONSOLE% write at the end of target command ` ?` and execute this by pressing `ENTER` eg. `quit ?`
